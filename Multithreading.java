/*
    As a concrete example, consider the example code below.
    The task is to compute the sum of all the integers from 0 to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
     In the first scenario, we have a single thread doing the summation
     while in the second scenario we split the range into two parts and have one thread sum for each range.
      In the end, we add the two half sums to get the combined sum.
     We measure the time taken for each scenario and print it.
